# A post about my Cats
April 9, 2022
## My cats
My family has 2 cats. They are named Cori (Coriander) and Sorrel.

## Cori
Cori is... Not as smart as some cats. He gets very exited about food. One time he was so exited and he ran up the basement stairs, but missed one and flew strait into a step. He can also be somewhat elegant... Sometimes... Let me think of some time he was elegant... Hmmm... Well here's another example of how clumsy he is: Some times when we use a laser to play with him he gets so exited he will run at close to full speed (quite fast - a fit adult cat can run almost 50 kilometers an hour - and he's definetly not fat) across the house... and when it keeps going and goes up on the wall, he slams into it. Sometimes. Usually he will jump. Usually. But sometimes he crashes.

## My cats are indoor cats.
Both of my cats are indoor cats. Both of them would love to be outdoor cats. We have harnesses and leashes for both of them. They like it when we let them walk us, although they would prefer to go outside without harnesses. *I will add more here later*

## Sorrel
Not done yet.
